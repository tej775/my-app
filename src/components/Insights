On TextForm:
By default, when you click on an <a> tag, it will try to navigate to the URL specified in the href attribute (in this case, /). Since you are not actually interested in navigating, but only want to update the font style, e.preventDefault() is used to stop the page from refreshing or navigating to the href.

Without e.preventDefault(), clicking the link would refresh the page or trigger a navigation, which you likely don't want in a React SPA (Single Page Application).

props.mode Doesn't Exist or Changes Dynamically:
Problem: If props.mode isn't passed into the component or if props.mode changes dynamically after the component is rendered, the initial value of myStyle.backgroundColor will not update automatically.
Solution: Use the useEffect hook to dynamically update myStyle when props.mode changes:
javascript
